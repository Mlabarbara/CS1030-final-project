        <h2>Data Analysis Questions and Hypotheses</h2>
    	<p>During the data analysis process, I formulated the following questions and hypotheses:</p>
    	<ul>
       		<li>What is the correlation between Fielding % and Win %?</li>
      		<li>Is there a relationship between Batting Average and Win %?</li>
     		<li>Does ERA impact Win %?</li>
    	</ul>

   		<h2>Data Analysis Results</h2>
    	<p>By analyzing the data, I obtained the following results:</p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>A positive correlation was found between Fielding % and Win %, indicating that better fielding performance tends to lead to more victories.</li>
       		<li>Teams with higher Batting Averages demonstrated a higher Win %, suggesting a connection between strong batting performance and team success.</li>
        	<li>Lower ERAs were associated with higher Win %, highlighting the significance of effective pitching in achieving wins.</li>
    	</ul>
    
    	<h2>This is a test</h2>
    	<p>Here is a picture of the data I processed:</p>
        
        <div class="image-carousel">
            <div class="carousel-slide">
                <img src="Picture2.png" alt="Image 1">
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-slide">
                <img src="Picture3.png" alt="Image 2">

			<p>In my data analysis project, I utilized an Excel CSV file containing baseball statistics to investigate the relationship between various performance metrics and team success. Specifically, I examined the correlation between Fielding Percentage (Fielding %), Batting Average, Earned Run Average (ERA), and their respective impacts on a team's Win Percentage (Win %). By importing the CSV file into a spreadsheet, I was able to easily manipulate and analyze the data.</p>
			
			<p>Firstly, I calculated the Fielding % for each team by dividing the total number of successful fielding attempts by the total number of chances. I then compared this metric against the corresponding Win % for each team. Through data visualization techniques such as scatter plots and trend lines, I determined whether a higher Fielding % correlated with a higher Win %, providing insights into the significance of fielding prowess in achieving success on the field.</p>
			
			<p>Next, I explored the relationship between Batting Average and Win %. By calculating the Batting Average for each team as the total number of hits divided by the total number of at-bats, I could examine whether teams with higher Batting Averages tended to have a higher Win %. Analyzing the data using statistical measures like correlation coefficients and regression analysis allowed me to evaluate the strength and direction of this relationship and draw conclusions about the impact of hitting performance on team success.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, I delved into the connection between ERA and Win %. Using the ERA metric, which represents the average number of earned runs given up by a team's pitchers per nine innings, I aimed to uncover any patterns between pitching performance and team success. By comparing the ERA of each team against their Win %, I assessed whether lower ERAs were associated with higher Win %, providing valuable insights into the importance of effective pitching in achieving victories.</p>
			
			<p>Overall, the Excel CSV file provided a comprehensive dataset that allowed me to conduct in-depth data analysis, exploring the relationships between Fielding %, Batting Average, ERA, and Win %. Through statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, I gained valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a team's success on the baseball field.</p>
